# This should be used as reference

This repository is just a reference of how to use Elm + Phoenix + Webpack + Hot Reload.

Also, you will see that changes in static repository will not trigger Phoenix reload
because hot-reload will take care of it

I will make an article about this setup, follow me on twitter (@douglas_correa) to keep updated.
